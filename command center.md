## Commands and Smart FAQ

## 1. Commands
Commands are quick replies that are shown as buttons on the widget. Instead of typing, users can click on Commands and get the information they need.

Once you click on the “Command Center” button, you will see a section called “Command sets for chatbot”. This is where you can manage Commands.

**Tips** 

Commands correspond with the Smart FAQs. There’s a place in the Smart FAQ section called “Suggested Quick Reply Option”, which serves as a suggestion for your Command.

## 2. Smart FAQ
Smart FAQ is a query that chatbot can recognize, understand and provide an answer to.

In this part, you will be able to see all FAQs that the chatbot can understand and where you can add or edit answers to FAQs.

## Turn off the chatbot
If your leasing representatives are available and want to take over the chat, you can turn off the chatbot. This will disable the chatbot (no more automatic answers) and your representatives can chat directly with the user.

### How to turn off the chatbot?
Hover over the left sidebar menu, go to the “Messages” section and click on the “Use Bot” button; the chatbot will be disabled for that particular chat. If you’d like to turn it back on, click on the “Use Bot” button again and if there’s a blue color, the chatbot is on again.

**Tips**

You can turn off the chatbot globally, not just for a particular chat but for every new chat you receive, so Apartment Ocean becomes a live-chat tool and your representatives can chat with users. 

If you’d like to completely turn off the chatbot, hover over the left sidebar menu, go to Widget Customization -> Use Chatbot, and turn it off.
