# Contacts -- Apartment Ocean User Tutorials

## Contact Management
As soon as a user engages with Apartment Ocean, a new contact is created. Every contact is stored in the “Contacts” part in your Dashboard. To access leads, please hover on the left sidebar menu and click on “Contacts”.

In the “Contacts” section, you will find several data points included in the lead. 

The contact consists user’s contact information, such as name. email address and phone number. You control what contact information that Apartment Ocean captures (“Widget Customization” -> Option 6)

Along with the contact information, Apartment Ocean also captures three other data points:

1. User’s referral source (website or page prior to the page where the user initiated the chat);

2. Actual page where the user initiated the chat;

3. User’s device;
