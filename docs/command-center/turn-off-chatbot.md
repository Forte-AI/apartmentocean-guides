# Turn off the chatbot
If your customer representatives are available and want to take over the chat, you can turn off the chatbot. This will disable the chatbot (no more automatic answers) and your representatives can chat directly with the user.

### How to turn off the chatbot?
Hover over the left sidebar menu, go to the “Messages” section and click on the “Use Bot” button; the chatbot will be disabled for that particular chat. If you’d like to turn it back on, click on the “Use Bot” button again and if there’s a blue color, the chatbot is on again.

**Tips**

You can turn off the chatbot globally, not just for a particular chat but for every new chat you receive, so Apartment Ocean becomes a live-chat tool and your representatives can chat with users. 

If you’d like to completely turn off the chatbot, hover over the left sidebar menu, go to Widget Customization -> Use Chatbot, and turn it off.
