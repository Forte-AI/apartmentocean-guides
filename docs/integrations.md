3.) Google Drive;

Let’s see how simple it is to export leads from Apartment Ocean to these systems.

## 2. Salesforce integration
Salesforce is the leading CRM system. To export leads from Apartment Ocean directly to Salesforce, you need to put their Salesforce login info (username and password) and provide an <a href="https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=remoteaccess_oidc_initial_access_token.htm&type=5">Salesforce Access Token</a>. Access Token can be found in the Salesforce account.

Click on the “Submit” button (as seen below) after putting the Salesforce Username, Password and Access Token in their designated fields.

After the request has been submitted, you will find their Apartment Ocean leads in their Salesforce system

## 3. Google Drive integration
Google Drive is one of the most popular cloud storage services. To export Apartment Ocean leads to Google Drive, you need to: 

1.) Name the new Google spreadsheet (the name is automatically created, but you can change it);

2.) Put your email address that is associated with your Google Drive;

3.) Set the authorization level (write or read), as seen in the screenshot below;

After you put the information in designated fields, simply click on the “Create Google Sheet” button and the new Google spreadsheet with Apartment Ocean leads will be created in Google Drive.
