# Messages -- Apartment Ocean User Tutorials

## Messages

This is the part where the entire conversation between users and the chatbot is stored. This is also the part where the property managers can chat with users themselves, if they have turned off the chatbot.

To access this section, please log in to your account and click on the “Messages” button in the “Menu”, as pictured below.

All previous conversations and current conversations can be seen in the “Messages” section. On the right side, you have the option to quickly find any previous conversation in the **search bar**.

Type in the name of the user and the conversation with that user will be shown in results.
